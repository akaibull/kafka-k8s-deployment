Apache Kafka is an event-streaming platform that runs as a cluster of nodes called “brokers” and was developed initially as a messaging queue. Today, Kafka can be used to process and store a massive amount of information all while seamlessly allowing applications to publish and consume these messages stored as records within a what is called a topic. Typically Kafka is used to efficiently broker data between systems or to allow applications to react to streams of data in real time. In addition to being a popular message queue for distributed systems, it is commonly used to stream data in IoT use cases.
